# Would You Rather

In this project we will build a **web app** that let's an user play the game **Would You Rather** game. Users need to be logged in to see the application content and the game goes like this:

> An user is asked a question in the form: **Would You Rather? [Option A] or [Option B]**

This app will let users answer questions, see already answered questions, create new questions and see the top 3 users on a ranking leaderboard.

This is a part of a Youtube video series :)
